              <h3>Essential Requirements for Seamless Administration</h3>
              <p>Through a meticulous requirements gathering process with the product management team, we garnered valuable 
                insights for enhancing the admin app and dashboard. Building upon these insights, we refined the dashboard to 
                encompass a multitude of features accessible within a single page. Notably, our design seamlessly transitions 
                into a mobile-friendly format, allowing users to preview the layout in real-time.

              <h3>Iterative Screen Designing</h3>
              <p>Throughout our design process, we embarked on a journey of continuous improvement, 
                crafting multiple iterations of our user interface.This iterative improvement 
                process ensures that the dashboard is not only feature-rich and user-friendly but also adaptable to various 
                devices, providing a holistic and efficient user experience. </p>

              <h3>Crafting Comprehensive Design Components</h3>
              <p>In the design process, I meticulously crafted reusable components with auto layout functionality to ensure 
                versatility across both the overall admin desktop dashboard and the mobile app. These components, 
                thoughtfully created in Figma, offer a systematic approach to design consistency. Leveraging auto 
                layout not only streamlines the arrangement and responsiveness of elements within these components 
                but also enhances their adaptability to different screen sizes and resolutions. This approach not 
                only accelerates the design process but also facilitates seamless updates and modifications, 
                ensuring a unified and cohesive visual identity throughout the entire user interface ecosystem.

            After successfully navigating a meticulous six-month journey of iterative development, we triumphantly introduced a 
            groundbreaking home page builder for NH Connect's admin portal. This transformative tool incorporates over 30 
            features meticulously outlined in the initial requirements. Through step-by-step iterations, both on mobile and web 
            applications, we ensured a seamless user experience and functionality that met and exceeded expectations. 
            The design garnered approval after reaching significant milestones, reflecting the dedication and expertise 
            invested in its creation.
            <br>
            Simultaneously, we undertook the strategic revamping of the Novant website, employing a comprehensive approach 
            grounded in competitor analysis and the creation of detailed user personas. This method allowed us to pinpoint 
            and address user pain points effectively. The end result is a revitalized Novant website that not only aligns 
            with industry standards but also prioritizes user satisfaction and engagement. These achievements underscore 
            our commitment to delivering innovative solutions and enhancing digital experiences for both NH Connect and Novant.
